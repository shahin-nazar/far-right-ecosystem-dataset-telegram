# BERTopic Modelling on Telegram Data

This repository contains data and models used to apply **BERT-based topic modeling** on **Telegram** datasets. The repo includes processed data, BERT model outputs, figures, and other materials used in the analysis and paper.

The repository is organized into several directories containing various components of the project. Below is a detailed description of the repository structure, usage, and how to cite this work.

## Repository Structure

- **additional-figures/**: Contains visualizations of the model's output in HTML format, used to guide research.
- **data/**: Contains the processed data, which includes chunked-up CSV files ready for analysis.
- **docs/**: Contains: a text file with parameters and settings used in the BERT model for topic modeling, a CSV file with all channel names of the dataset, a CSV file with Active Club channel names used to filter dataset and process with BERTopic, a TXT file of the code used. 
- **figures/**: Contains figures used in the associated paper (e.g., topic visualizations, charts) in JPG format.
- **model-output/**: Contains the results of the topic modeling in CSV format, including topic labels and related data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform topic modeling on a set of **Telegram data** using **BERT-based models**. The dataset was preprocessed, chunked into manageable parts, and then passed through a **BERT model** for topic extraction. The results are stored as CSV files and visualized through various figures and plots as a visual guide for research.

The repository contains all necessary data and figures to reproduce the work done in the associated research paper.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from **public Telegram channels** and **groups**. The data consists of messages and interactions, which were preprocessed into CSV format. 

### Data Description:

- The **processed data** is stored in the `data/` directory. It includes multiple CSV files that have been chunked to fit into BERT-based topic models.
- Each CSV file contains columns for message text, date, user (if available), and metadata.
  
We ensured respect for Telegram's [Terms of Service](https://telegram.org/tos) and **data privacy** laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when working with this dataset.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- A BERT model for topic modeling

### Model Settings

The **BERT-based topic modeling** pipeline includes the following settings:

1. **CountVectorizer**:
    - **stop_words**: 'english' (removes common English stopwords)
    - **min_df**: 2 (ignores terms that appear in fewer than 2 documents)
    - **ngram_range**: (1, 2) (uses unigrams and bigrams)

2. **HDBSCAN** (for clustering topics):
    - **min_cluster_size**: 150 (minimum size of each cluster)
    - **metric**: 'euclidean' (distance metric for clustering)
    - **cluster_selection_method**: 'eom' (used for selecting clusters)
    - **prediction_data**: True (enables prediction on new data)

3. **UMAP** (for dimensionality reduction):
    - **n_neighbors**: 15 (number of neighboring points used for manifold approximation)
    - **n_components**: 5 (reduces the data to 5 components for the clustering)
    - **min_dist**: 0.0 (controls how tightly UMAP packs points together)
    - **metric**: 'cosine' (distance metric for UMAP)

4. **BERTopic** (the main topic model):
    - **embedding_model**: Your BERT embedding model (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`)
    - **umap_model**: UMAP model used for dimensionality reduction
    - **vectorizer_model**: CountVectorizer model used for tokenization
    - **top_n_words**: 20 (number of top words to display for each topic)
    - **verbose**: True (provides detailed output during the topic modeling process)

5. **UMAP for Reduced Embeddings**:
    - **n_neighbors**: 10 (number of neighboring points for the reduced space)
    - **n_components**: 2 (reduces the embeddings to 2 components for visualization)
    - **min_dist**: 0.0 (controls how tightly UMAP packs points together)
    - **metric**: 'cosine' (distance metric for UMAP)

# Example of reduced embeddings visualization

```python
reduced_embeddings = UMAP(n_neighbors=10, n_components=2, min_dist=0.0, metric='cosine').fit_transform(embeddings)
```

## Results

The topic modeling results are stored in the `model-output/` folder in CSV format. 

## Figures

The visualizations of the BERT model's output, including topic distributions and other figures used in the associated paper, are stored in the `figures/` folder. Images from Telegram are in JPG format and can be directly used in publications or presentations.
